# Random Quote Generator

This project is a random quote generator.

## Description

This project is a random quote generator that displays one of ten possible quotes, every 5 seconds. In addition, the source, citation, year, and type of quote may display underneath the random quote. The 10 quotes were manually input into the program.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply load the document on the Google Chrome browser. The random quote generator will automatically begin functioning on it's own upon page start up. You can also select the 'Show another quote' button to display a new quote before the next quote auto-refreshes.

## Help

You may notice that the random quote generator will auto-refresh in 5-seconds, starting when the document loads on your browser. With that said, there may be instances when quotes are auto-displayed in intervals less than 5 seconds if you select the 'Show anoher quote' button manually.
